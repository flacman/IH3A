For every machine: user: cse253, pass: cse253

Before starting, check that your host vm have the IP 192.168.16.1
(Edit/network editor)
The agend should access always through 192.168.16.147
To start the whole environment:
	In Apps VM, run in different terminals the apps and the helper (ctrl+alt+f1, f2, f3, etc)
	In your host, run just the syslog server (I didn't use the other one)
	
CHANGE: In SecProxy vm:
	sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
	change the line 
		port-groups: 
			HTTP_PORTS: "80"
	to
		port-groups:
			HTTP_PORTS: "8081,8082"

VM1: SecProxy
IP: 192.168.16.147
It's a reverse proxy for accessing the apps:
	Mod_Security Config
		/etc/apache2/modsecurity/crs-setup.conf
		/etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf
	Mod_proxy
		Site: vulnerable.com.conf
			Por 8081 Points to: 	http://192.168.16.146:8081
			Por 8082 Points to:		http://192.168.16.146:8082
	Suricata
		/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
	Syslog
		This will get logs on /var/log/modsecurity/error.log and /var/log/suricata.info.log and send them to 192.168.16.1
		
		/etc/syslogd/.conf

VM1: Apps
IP: 192.168.16.146
Here is where the appss are:
	Ossec Config
		/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
	
	Apps
		/home/App1/ (runs on port 8081)
		/home/App2/ (runs on port 8082)
		/home/RLHelper.py (runs on port 80)
	MySQL
		Access to database: sudo mysql
		Users, passwords and databases are the same that are coded in the apps
